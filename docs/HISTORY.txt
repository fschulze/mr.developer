  checkout.
  [fschulze]

1.6 - 2009-11-21

  revision is lower, then the package is updated.
  [fschulze]

1.3 - 2009-11-15

  buildout. Such changes are now picked up immediately.
  [fschulze]

* Added tests and a buildout to run them easily.
  [fschulze]

1.2 - 2009-11-12
----------------

* If a package is removed from ``auto-checkout`` and wasn't explicitly

  [fschulze]

1.1 - 2009-08-07
----------------

  if possible. This fixes issues if your buildout path contains a space.
  [fschulze]

* Warn when trying to activate or deactivate a package which isn't checked out.
  [fschulze]

* Don't depend on elementree on Python >= 2.5, because it's builtin there.
  [fschulze]

* When checking out a source it will automatically be activated.
  [fschulze]

* Use 'sources' as the default section name for source information.
  [fschulze]

1.0 - 2009-05-02
----------------

* Added ``info`` command to print various informations about packages.
  [fschulze]

  buildout.
  [fschulze]

* Got rid of deprecation warning in Python 2.6 by removing unnecessary call
  of __init__ in working copy implementations.
  [fschulze]

0.15 - 2009-04-17
-----------------

  [fschulze]

  [fschulze]

0.14 - 2009-04-16
-----------------

* Added ``-f`` option to ``update`` command to force updates even if the
  working copy is dirty.
  [fschulze]

0.13 - 2009-04-14
-----------------

* Added ``-a`` option to ``update`` command to only update the packages
  declared in the ``auto-checkout`` list.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` commands. This allows to select which
  packages are added to the ``develop`` option of zc.buildout. Enhanced the
  ``status`` command to show the additional informations.
  [fschulze]

* Switched the meaning of ``~`` and ``C`` in status command.
  [fschulze]

0.12 - 2009-04-14
-----------------

* Added support for Mercurial (hg).
  [mj]

* Refactored working copy logic, so it's easier to add support for other
  version control systems.
  [fschulze]

* Added verbose flag to ``checkout`` and ``update`` commands.
  [fschulze]

0.11 - 2009-04-06
-----------------

* Removed the nice os.path.relpath usage, because it's only been introduced
  with Python 2.6.
  [fschulze]

0.10 - 2009-04-06
-----------------

* Added verbose flag to ``status`` command.
  [fschulze]

* Deprecated ``sources-svn`` and ``sources-git`` in favour of just ``sources``
  which allows more flexibility.
  [fschulze]

* Changed ``status`` command to only check known paths and not the whole
  ``sources-dir`` path.
  [fschulze]

* Add possibility to filter packages in ``update`` and ``status`` commands.
  [fschulze]

* Tell the user at the end of the buildout run whether there have been any
  errors during automatic checkout.
  [fschulze]

* Install the ``develop`` script as the first part instead of the last, so it
  can be used to fix problems.
  [fschulze]

0.9 - 2009-03-30
----------------

* When installed as just an egg, then the resulting ``develop`` script can be
  called from anywhere and will try to find the correct ``develop`` script
  from the current working directory and execute it.
  [fschulze]

* Fixed help text formatting.
  [fschulze]

0.8 - 2009-03-25
----------------

* Added authentication support to subversion commands.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``-a`` option to ``checkout`` command to limit matching to the
  packages declared by the ``auto-checkout`` option. If no further argument
  is given, then all the packages from ``auto-checkout`` are processed.
  [fschulze]

0.7 - 2009-03-24
----------------

* Added ``update`` command to ``checkout`` script.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``status`` command to ``checkout`` script.
  [fschulze]

* Added status flag to ``list`` command to indicate packages with wrong URL.
  [fschulze]

* If the working copy is clean, then checkout automatically switches svn
  packages.
  [fschulze]

  and you get a chance to inspect and fix the problems.
  [fschulze]

* Check remote url and stop checkout if it differs.
  [fschulze]

* Added various options to the ``list`` command.
  [fschulze]
