1.13 - 2010-04-11

  check which packages are still updating now that the output is only printed
  after everything is done due to parallel checkouts.

1.7 - 2009-11-26
----------------

  checkout.
  [fschulze]

1.6 - 2009-11-21

1.4 - 2009-11-16

  revision is lower, then the package is updated.
  [fschulze]

1.3 - 2009-11-15
----------------

* Read the cfg used by last buildout run. This prevents unexpected behaviour,
  if you change mr.developer options like source declarations and don't run
  buildout. Such changes are now picked up immediately.
  [fschulze]

* Added tests and a buildout to run them easily.
  [fschulze]

1.2 - 2009-11-12
----------------

* If a package is removed from ``auto-checkout`` and wasn't explicitly
  activated, then it will be removed from the develop packages automatically.

  [miohtama, fschulze]

* All commands have a ``-h`` and ``--help`` option now to show their help.
  [fschulze]

1.1 - 2009-08-07
----------------

* Use relative paths from the buildout directory for the ``develop`` option
  if possible. This fixes issues if your buildout path contains a space.
  [fschulze]

* Warn when trying to activate or deactivate a package which isn't checked out.
  [fschulze]

* Don't depend on elementree on Python >= 2.5, because it's builtin there.
  [fschulze]

* When checking out a source it will automatically be activated.
  [fschulze]

* Use 'sources' as the default section name for source information.
  [fschulze]

* Added support for filesystem packages without version control with the
  'fs' type.
  [fschulze]

------------------

  [fschulze]

* SVN externals no longer cause a modified status.
  [fschulze]

1.0 - 2009-05-02
----------------

* Added ``info`` command to print various informations about packages.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``reset`` command to reset the develop state of packages. This is
  useful when switching to a new buildout configuration. During the next
  buildout run the develop state is determined the same way as in a clean
  buildout.
  [fschulze]

* Got rid of deprecation warning in Python 2.6 by removing unnecessary call
  of __init__ in working copy implementations.
  [fschulze]

0.15 - 2009-04-17
-----------------

* Added reminder to run buildout after activating or deactivating packages.
  [fschulze]

  [fschulze]

0.14 - 2009-04-16
-----------------

* Fixed verbose output of ``checkout`` command.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``-f`` option to ``update`` command to force updates even if the
  working copy is dirty.
  [fschulze]

0.13 - 2009-04-14
-----------------

* Added ``-a`` option to ``update`` command to only update the packages
  declared in the ``auto-checkout`` list.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` commands. This allows to select which
  packages are added to the ``develop`` option of zc.buildout. Enhanced the
  ``status`` command to show the additional informations.
  [fschulze]

* Switched the meaning of ``~`` and ``C`` in status command.
  [fschulze]

0.12 - 2009-04-14
-----------------

* Added support for Mercurial (hg).
  [mj]

* Refactored working copy logic, so it's easier to add support for other
  version control systems.
  [fschulze]

* Added verbose flag to ``checkout`` and ``update`` commands.
  [fschulze]

0.11 - 2009-04-06
-----------------

* Removed the nice os.path.relpath usage, because it's only been introduced
  with Python 2.6.
  [fschulze]

0.10 - 2009-04-06
-----------------

* Added verbose flag to ``status`` command.
  [fschulze]

* Deprecated ``sources-svn`` and ``sources-git`` in favour of just ``sources``
  which allows more flexibility.
  [fschulze]

* Changed ``status`` command to only check known paths and not the whole
  ``sources-dir`` path.
  [fschulze]

* Add possibility to filter packages in ``update`` and ``status`` commands.
  [fschulze]

* Tell the user at the end of the buildout run whether there have been any
  errors during automatic checkout.
  [fschulze]

* Install the ``develop`` script as the first part instead of the last, so it
  can be used to fix problems.
  [fschulze]

0.9 - 2009-03-30
----------------

* When installed as just an egg, then the resulting ``develop`` script can be
  called from anywhere and will try to find the correct ``develop`` script
  from the current working directory and execute it.
  [fschulze]

* Fixed help text formatting.
  [fschulze]

0.8 - 2009-03-25
----------------

* Added authentication support to subversion commands.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``-a`` option to ``checkout`` command to limit matching to the
  packages declared by the ``auto-checkout`` option. If no further argument
  is given, then all the packages from ``auto-checkout`` are processed.
  [fschulze]

0.7 - 2009-03-24
----------------

* Added ``update`` command to ``checkout`` script.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``status`` command to ``checkout`` script.
  [fschulze]

* Added status flag to ``list`` command to indicate packages with wrong URL.
  [fschulze]

* If the working copy is clean, then checkout automatically switches svn
  packages.
  [fschulze]

  and you get a chance to inspect and fix the problems.
  [fschulze]

* Check remote url and stop checkout if it differs.
  [fschulze]

* Added various options to the ``list`` command.
  [fschulze]

* Instead of the ``checkout`` script, there is now a ``develop`` script with
  various commands.
  [fschulze]

  need to use a pipe symbol and quotes.
  [fschulze]
